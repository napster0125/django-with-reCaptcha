Installation

#. Install or add ``django-recaptcha`` to your Python path.

Usage
-----

django-registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
django-recaptcha ships with a `django-registration <https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration>`_ backend extending the default backend to include a reCAPTCHA field. This is included mostly as an example of how you could intergrate a reCAPTCHA field with django-registration. I suggest you familiarize yourself with `the django-registration docs <http://docs.b-list.org/django-registration/0.8/index.html>`_ for more comprehensive documentation. 

To use the reCAPTHCA backend complete these steps:

#. Add captcha registration backend url include to your project's ``urls.py`` file::

    (r'^accounts/', include('captcha.backends.default.urls')),

#. Add an ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS`` setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file. This is the number of days users will have to activate their accounts after registering, as required by django-registration, i.e.::
    
    ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS = 7

#. Implement various `templates as required by django-registration <http://docs.b-list.org/django-registration/0.8/quickstart.html#required-templates>`_.

Once done you should be able to access `/accounts/register/ <http://localhost:8000/accounts/register/>`_ and see reCAPTCHA in action.
